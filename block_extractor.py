'''
Write a generic function that:
Takes a 2D NumPy array A and a tuple block_shape = (rows, cols)
Validates that the shape of A is divisible by the block_shape
Returns all non-overlapping blocks of that shape as a flat list
Each block must be a NumPy array of shape block_shape
No loops for slicing â€” use nested comprehensions or pure slicing
Validate divisibility and raise ValueError if incompatible
Each block must be a separate copy, not just a view (use .copy())
